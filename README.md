# Color Scheme Generator  
This project is a color scheme generator built based on a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/twasy8Bca4hW7gunLFSLoY/Color-Scheme-Generator?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=Wrfv3V07dcgMjB3P-0).  
You can view the live project [here](https://1color-scheme-generator.netlify.app/).  

## About The Project  
The goal of this project is to generate different color schemes based on a user-selected color.  
I recreated the design with **HTML** and **CSS** to ensure a clean and minimal interface.  
Then, I integrated **JavaScript** to handle color picking, API requests, and dynamic rendering of color schemes.  

This project uses the [The Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) to fetch scheme data such as triad, analogic, monochrome, and more.  

## Features  
- **HTML & CSS**: A simple and responsive interface faithful to the Figma design.  
- **JavaScript**:  
  - Allows users to pick a base color.  
  - Fetches scheme data from [The Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/).  
  - Dynamically updates the UI with generated color palettes and their hex codes.  

## How To Use  
1. Select a base color by clicking on the color box.  
2. Choose a scheme type (e.g., Analogic, Triad, Monochrome) from the dropdown menu.  
3. Click the **Get Scheme** button.  
4. The generated palette and corresponding hex codes will appear below.
